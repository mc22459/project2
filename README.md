create and print a digital form by merging at least two clean 3D scans of one or more humans.
goals, choices made, outcome, etc.)

I've always been a fan of ~the theatre~. For prject 2 i decided to make a mask of my face as to create a dramatized version of myself. I took the scan of my torso+head from hw5 and then scanned my face again. I wanted more detail on the head so that there would hopefully be some resembalnce. I didnt use a skanect licensed computer, but the second scan I did of only my head turned out much clearer than the first. Determined to test Meshmixer, I completed the project using only it. And it was quite difficult!
